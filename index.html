            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="mid-pera">I’m usually skeptical when it comes to prepared meals, since it’s hard to compete with
                freshly made
                dinners. However, Factor pleasantly surprised me. Not only were the dishes flavorful, but the textures
                of the ingredients were also spot-on.</p>
